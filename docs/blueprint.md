# **App Name**: Finan√ßasZen

## Core Features:

- Transaction Management: CRUD operations for managing financial transactions, including details like date, amount, category, and description.
- Automated Document Processing: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and AI-powered processing of uploaded documents (receipts, invoices) to extract transaction data. The LLM uses a tool to help it decide whether questions need to be asked of the user.
- Interactive Disambiguation: A user-friendly interface that allows the user to validate ambiguous interpretations proposed by the AI, enabling it to 'learn' how to better interpet data in the future.
- Budgeting: Tools for creating and managing budgets by category. Display current vs. limit with visual progress bars.
- Dashboard: Visual representation of financial data, including charts and key indicators, and shortcuts to filtering categories of data.
- Preferences: A preferences panel so the user can indicate regional preferences and customize their own set of spending categories.
- Recurring Transactions: Management of rules for setting up and scheduling recurring transactions, with detailed UI to manage recurrence.
